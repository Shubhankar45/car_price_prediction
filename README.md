# 🚗 Car Price Prediction – ML Web App (Flask + Docker)

This project is an **end-to-end Machine Learning web application** that predicts the selling price of used cars based on multiple features such as manufacturing year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, ownership, and seller type.

The application demonstrates the **complete ML lifecycle** — from model training to deployment — using **Flask** and **Docker**.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Trained a **regression-based ML model** using `scikit-learn`
- Built a **Flask web application** to serve predictions
- Integrated HTML templates and static assets
- Serialized the trained model using **Joblib**
- Containerized the entire application using **Docker**
- Ready for local execution and cloud deployment
